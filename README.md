# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to create a dashboard that pulls demographic information and visualizes bacterial data for volunteers participating in a synthetic beef research project for Improbable Beef who is in search for the perfect bacteria for flavoring their new product. Participating volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons using the created dashboard. Once Improbable Beef makes their decision on the bacteria needed for their beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether or not that species if found in their navel.

## Project Deployment
